### What I Learned
- Used regular expressions to detect patterns related to sensitive information
- Learned how data leaks can occur through plain text input
- Improved understanding of basic cybersecurity scanning concepts

### What I Built
- A simple text scanner that checks for sensitive information like emails, IP addresses, and card numbers
- A basic cybersecurity tool for detecting potential data leaks

### What Failed
- Initial pattern matching missed some valid formats
- Some inputs triggered false positives

### How I Fixed It
- Updated and refined pattern rules to make detection more flexible
- Tested with different input examples to reduce false alerts

### Security Insight
- Sensitive information can easily be exposed if not properly validated
- Simple scanning tools can help identify potential data leaks early
- Even basic security scripts can improve awareness and prevention
