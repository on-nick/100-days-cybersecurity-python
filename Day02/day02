## what i learned
--  How to import a Python module using import
--  Basic use of the re module
--  How re.search() checks if a word exists in a line
--  Difference between normal text search and regex search (basic idea)

##  what i built
--  A simple Python script that:
--  Reads a file line by line
--  Prints only the lines that contain the word “failed”
--  A very basic custom grep-like program

##  What Failed
--  Initially did not understand why import re was required
--  Expected the program to print something even when the word was not present

##  How I Fixed It
--  Learned that re.search() returns nothing (None) if the word is not found
--  Understood that only matching lines are printed
--  Tested different words to see how the output changes

##  Security Insight
--  Searching logs for keywords is the first step in attack detection
--  Even simple keyword matching can help identify failed login attempts
--  Automation starts with small scripts like this
