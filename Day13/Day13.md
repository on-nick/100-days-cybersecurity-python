###  What I Learned
```
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code
Common Python errors like SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, and ValueError
How to read and understand Python error tracebacks
The importance of handling exceptions properly
```
###  What I Built
```
Wrote small Python scripts with intentional bugs
Practiced fixing syntax and logic errors
Used print statements to trace variable values
Implemented basic try and except blocks
```

###  What Failed
```
Misunderstood some error messages initially
Forgot to handle invalid user input
Code crashed when unexpected values were provided
```

###  How I Fixed It
```
Carefully read traceback messages
Used print debugging to follow code execution
Added try and except blocks to handle errors
Tested code with different inputs
```

###  Security Insight
```
Unhandled errors can expose sensitive information
Proper error handling helps prevent crashes and abuse
Debugging helps identify logic flaws attackers could exploit
Secure programs should fail safely and predictably

```
