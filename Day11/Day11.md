##  What I Learned
```
The overall goal of Chapter 1 in Black Hat Python
How Python can interact with the system and network at a low level
Why Black Hat Python focuses on understanding behavior instead of full tools
The importance of reading code slowly and conceptually
```

###  What I Built
```
Read Chapter 1 carefully and analyzed the examples
Ran a few basic examples to observe their behavior
Focused on understanding concepts rather than modifying code
```
###  What Failed
```
Some parts of the chapter felt difficult on the first read
Not all examples were immediately clear
```

###  How I Fixed It
```
Re-read difficult sections without rushing
Ignored advanced details and focused on the main idea of each example
```

###  Security Insight
```
Security tools are composed of small, understandable building blocks
Understanding how code behaves is more important than automation
Patience is essential when learning offensive security
```
