## What I Learned
```
What the Python requests library is
How to send a simple HTTP GET request
How to read a response status code
How to view website content using Python
```

##  What I Built
```
A basic Python script that sends a GET request to a website
Printed the HTTP status code and response text
```
##  What Failed
```
Got an error because the requests library was not installed
The output was too long and confusing at first
```
##  How I Fixed it
```
Installed the library using pip3 install requests
Focused only on the status code instead of full HTML output
```
##  Security Insight
```
Websites respond differently based on requests
Status codes help identify accessible or broken pages
Many security tools are built on automated HTTP requests
```
