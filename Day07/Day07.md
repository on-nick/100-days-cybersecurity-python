###  What I Learned
```
How to use the Python random module
Generate random numbers using random.randint()
Pick a random item from a list using random.choice()
Shuffle a list using random.shuffle()
```

###  What I Built
```
A small Python script that:
Generates a random number between 1 and 10
Picks a random color from a list
Shuffles a list of numbers
```

###  What Failed
```
Initially tried to use random functions without importing the module → program crashed
Misunderstood how random.shuffle() works (it shuffles in-place)
```

###  How I Fixed It
```
Added import random at the top of the script
Printed the list after shuffling to see the result
```
###  Security Insight
```
Randomness is key for generating passwords, tokens, and OTPs
Security tools use randomness to avoid predictability
Understanding basic random operations is the foundation for more advanced security scripts
```
