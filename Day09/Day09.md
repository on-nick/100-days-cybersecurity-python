###  What I Learned
```
What Black Hat Python is about and its learning approach
How Python is used in offensive and defensive security
The importance of understanding low-level concepts instead of tools
Ethical responsibility when learning security concepts
```

###  What I Built
```
Set up the learning environment for Black Hat Python
Read and understood the introductory concepts and examples
```

###  What Failed
```
Some concepts felt complex at first read
Needed to re-read sections to understand the purpose of certain examples
```

###  How I Fixed It
```
Slowed down and focused on understanding concepts instead of code execution
Took notes and related ideas to what I already know in Python
```

###  Security Insight
```
Security tools are built from simple building blocks
Understanding fundamentals gives more power than memorizing tools
Responsible learning is critical when studying offensive security
```
