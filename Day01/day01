### What I Learned
--  Reading files in Python using open() and with
--  Difference between file modes (r vs w)
--  How to process files line by line
--  Why reading line-by-line is important for large log files

##  what i built
--  A simple Python script that reads a text file line by line
--  A basic filter that prints only lines containing a specific keyword (e.g., failed)

##  What Failed
--  Accidentally opened a file using w mode instead of r
--  Lost the original content of the file

##  How I Fixed It
--  Switched the file mode from w to r
--  Understood when to use w, a, and r safely
--  Re-created the test file and re-ran the script

##  Security Insight
--  Log files are critical forensic evidence
--  Using the wrong file mode can destroy important data
--  Attack detection tools must read logs safely without modifying them
