### What I Learned
- What passive reconnaissance means in cybersecurity
- How APIs allow programs to communicate
- Why threat intelligence platforms like VirusTotal exist
- The difference between passive and active information gathering

### What I Built
- Read and understood conceptual examples of API usage
- Analyzed how Python can interact with external services

### What Failed
- Some API concepts were confusing at first
- Understanding reconnaissance without direct interaction was challenging

### How I Fixed It
- Re-read explanations using simple real-world analogies
- Focused on understanding concepts instead of technical details

### Security Insight
- Passive reconnaissance reduces detection risk
- APIs are widely used in both offensive and defensive security
- Responsible use of public data is essential
