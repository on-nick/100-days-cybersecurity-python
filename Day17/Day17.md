### What I Learned
- How to securely generate random passwords using Python
- Why the `secrets` module is preferred over `random` for security-sensitive tasks
- How combining letters, numbers, and symbols improves password strength

### What I Built
- A reusable password generator function with a configurable length
- A simple script that outputs a newly generated secure password

### What Failed
- The password variable was not displayed correctly due to incorrect string formatting

### How I Fixed It
- Corrected the f-string syntax to properly interpolate the password variable

### Security Insight
- Cryptographically secure randomness is essential for password generation
- Strong passwords rely on both length and character diversity
