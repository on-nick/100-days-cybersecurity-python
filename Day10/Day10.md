How Python is used as a security tool rather than a scripting language
The importance of learning security concepts step by step
The ethical responsibility involved in learning offensive security

Reviewed the book structure and planned a learning approach
```

###  What Failed
```
Initially expected faster progress through the material
Realized some topics require strong fundamentals
```

###  How I Fixed It
```
Decided to move slowly and focus on understanding concepts
Planned to document learning progress daily instead of rushing
