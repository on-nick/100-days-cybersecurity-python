### What I Learned
- How brute-force attacks work and why limiting login attempts is important.

### What I Built
- A Brute Force Protection System that restricts login attempts and adds delay after failures.

### What Failed

### How I Fixed It
- Added a maximum attempt limit and introduced a delay after each failed attempt.

### Security Insight
- Limiting authentication attempts helps prevent brute-force attacks and protects user accounts.
